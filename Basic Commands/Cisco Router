# Cisco Router's basic Commands

A router is a device that worked on Network layer (layer 3) OSI model and used to forward packets from one network to another. The router determines the optimal outgoing intrface by matching the destination IP address against its routing table entries and then forwards the packet accordingly.

Now, we will talk about cisco router's basic commands like assigning an IP address to an interface, bringing up an interface, applying to enable and secret passwords.

## 1. Access Modes

| Command                | Description                                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `enable`               | Enter privileged EXEC mode to access advanced commands.       |
| `configure terminal`   | Enter global configuration mode to modify router settings.    |
| `exit`                 | Exit the current mode and return to the previous mode.        |

## 2. Basic Router Configuration
hostname Router1
- Sets the routerâ€™s hostname for easier identification.

enable secret YourPassword
- Secures privileged EXEC mode with a password.

no ip domain-lookup
- Disables DNS lookup to prevent delays on mistyped commands.

##3. Interface Configuration
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
- Selects the interface to configure.

ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
- Assigns IP address and subnet mask to the interface.

no shutdown
- Enables the interface.

exit
- Exits interface configuration mode.

## 4. Routing Configuration
Static Route
ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2
- Manually adds a route via the specified next-hop IP.

OSPF Routing
router ospf 1
- Starts OSPF routing process with process ID 1.

network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
- Includes the specified network in OSPF area 0.

## 5. Password and Access Control
line console 0
 password YourPassword
 login
- Sets console line password and enables login.

line vty 0 4
 password YourPassword
 login
- Sets passwords for virtual terminal lines for remote access.

## 6. Save Configuration
write memory
- Saves running configuration to non-volatile memory.

copy running-config startup-config
- Alternative command to save configuration.

Troubleshooting Commands
| Command                      |	Description                                               |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|show ip interface brief       | Summary of interfaces, IP addresses, and status.          |
|show running-config	          | Displays current configuration in RAM.                    |
|show ip route	                | Shows the routing table.                                  |
|show ip protocols	            | Shows routing protocols info.                             |
|show interfaces               | Detailed interface status and statistics.                 |
|show ip ospf neighbor	        | Displays OSPF neighbors and adjacency status.             |
|ping [destination IP]	        | Tests connectivity to a destination IP address.           |
|traceroute [destination IP]	  | Shows the route packets take to a destination.            |
|debug ip routing	             | Displays real-time routing events for troubleshooting.    |
|show logging	                 | Displays system logs and error messages.                  |

Keep practicing these commands to become confident in configuring and troubleshooting Cisco routers!
