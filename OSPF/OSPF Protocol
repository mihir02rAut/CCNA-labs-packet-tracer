# 🔷 Cisco OSPF Protocol Configuration Guide

This README provides a basic setup for OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) on Cisco routers.

---

## 🛠️ Basic Router Setup

```bash
enable
configure terminal
hostname ROUTER_NAME
no ip domain-lookup
```

---

## 🌐 Interface IP Configuration

```bash
interface FastEthernet0/0
  ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
  no shutdown
exit

interface FastEthernet0/1
  ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
  no shutdown
exit
```

---

## 🔁 OSPF Configuration

```bash
router ospf 1
  network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
  network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
exit
```

---

## 🔍 Verification Commands

```bash
show ip protocols
show ip ospf neighbor
show ip route ospf
show running-config
```

---

## 💾 Save Configuration

```bash
copy running-config startup-config
```

---

## 🧠 Notes

- OSPF is a link-state protocol and uses areas (Area 0 is backbone).
- Use wildcard masks in the `network` command.
- OSPF is more scalable than RIP.
