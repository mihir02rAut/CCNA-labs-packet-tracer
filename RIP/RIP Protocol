# 🌐 Cisco RIP Protocol Configuration Guide

This README provides a basic setup guide for configuring RIP (Routing Information Protocol) on Cisco routers.

---

## 🛠️ Basic Router Setup

```bash
enable                          # Enter privileged EXEC mode
configure terminal              # Enter global configuration mode
hostname ROUTER_NAME            # Set router hostname
no ip domain-lookup             # Disable DNS lookup
```

---

## 🌐 Interface IP Configuration

```bash
interface FastEthernet0/0
  ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
  no shutdown
exit

interface FastEthernet0/1
  ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
  no shutdown
exit
```

---

## 🔁 RIP Routing Configuration

```bash
router rip
  version 2                         # Use RIP version 2
  no auto-summary                   # Disable automatic summarization
  network 192.168.1.0               # Include directly connected networks
  network 10.0.0.0
exit
```

---

## 🔍 Verify RIP Configuration

```bash
show ip protocols                  # View RIP settings
show ip route                      # Check the routing table
show running-config               # See current router config
```

---

## 🔄 Useful Debug Commands (Use with caution)

```bash
debug ip rip                       # Show RIP routing updates in real-time
undebug all                        # Disable all debugging
```

---

## 💾 Save Configuration

```bash
copy running-config startup-config
```

---

## 🧠 Notes

- RIP is a distance-vector protocol with a max hop count of 15.
- Version 2 supports subnet masks and multicast updates.
- Avoid using RIP for large or modern networks — it's mostly for labs or legacy support.
